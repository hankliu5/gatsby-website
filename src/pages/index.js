                What do I like to do? Lots of course but definitely enjoy building
                websites.

            <h1>Richard Hamming on Luck</h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    From Richard Hamming’s classic and must-read talk, “<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html">
                        You and Your Research
        </a>”.
      </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        There is indeed an element of luck, and no, there isn’t. The prepared
                        mind sooner or later finds something important and does it. So yes, it
          is luck.{" "}
                        <em>
                            The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is
                            not.
